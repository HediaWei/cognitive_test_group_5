    " On each trial of this task, two dot arrays ranging in numerosity from 9 to 21 were presented for 750 ms on each side of a central fixation cross, after which only the fixation cross remained on the screen. Participants were asked to judge which side contained more dots as quickly and as accurately as possible by a manual (left or right index fingers) button press. The response was accepted from stimulus onset until 3 s after the stimulus onset, which was followed by an intertrial interval of 1.5 s before the onset of the following trial. \n",
